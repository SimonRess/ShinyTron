# 1. Creating Electron-App by Hand ####
#-------------------------------------#

# I. General steps to prepare the template:
  # 1. Install [Node.js](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rportable/) -> JavaScript Runtime, used for installation and running of the scripts
  # 2. Download repo: https://github.com/SimonRess/Shiny-Electron/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
  # 3. Download & Install [R-Portable](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rportable/files/R-Portable/)
  # 4. Then copy the contents of the "App\R-Portable" subdirectory to the "R-Portable-Win" subfolder of the "shiny-electron"-folder.
  #    The folders "test", "docs" (and possibly also "TCL") can be deleted to save storage space in the app.
  # 5. Create helper-scripts for the create of the app: type `npm install electron-packager -g` in the "Node.js command prompt"
  #    The "-g" parameter ensures that the script is available globally and not just for a single project.
  #    This means that it will also be available for other shiny apps in the future.
  # 6. Switch to the "shiny-electron"-folder: e.g. `cd C:\...\shiny-electron-main`
  # 7. Download other necessary program libraries: `npm install` (Install dependencies for electron) & `npm audit fix` (Update dependencies)
#
# II. Customize individual app
  # 1. (A) Open R-Studio and (B) Install all required packages of your app into the "shiny-electron-main\R-Portable-Win\library"-folder:
  #    e.g. `install.packages("shiny", lib = "C:/Users/simon/Desktop/StandaloneApp/shiny-electron-main/R-Portable-Win/library")`
  # 2. Adjusting the configuration of the app within the "package.json"-file:
  #    - name: The name of the app (shown in the title bar). This entry must be repeated in the script.
  #    - description: Description of the app
  #    - scripts: The instructions for building the program. Further options can be adjusted here
  #      -out=Path: The target path where the program will be placed
  #      -version-string.CompanyName=MyCompany: The publisher
  #      -version-string.ProductName=\"Shiny Electron App\": The name of the app. Here, quotation marks must be escaped with \
  #      -repository: The information is only relevant if the program is published in a repository
  # 3. Create the program by typing `npm run package-win` in the "Node.js command prompt".
  #    (We need to be in the folder that contains the "package.json" file)
#
# III. Run the app
  # 1. After the script has run through, a subfolder with the finished program appears in the folder configured under "--out".
  # 2. The app can be started by double-clicking on "Appname.exe" (in the template "Shiny Electron App.exe").
